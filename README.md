# GraphQL-Test-Ecommerce

A simple E-commerce API with GraphQL and only 3 entities.

This is a simple project, an E-commerce with only 3 entities which is `User`, `Product` and `Comment`. Each user can be a regular one, or an admin or a super-admin. Then an admin or a higher rank can create products and users can comment on the products. Any further functionalities, and potentially more real-world ones were ignored for the sake of simplicity, because the project is for the learning, and the reason for implementing it is to learn the **RAW GRAPHQL DESIGN**.

I'm going to try using the **GRAPHQL** package for the next projects to use the pre-made classess and objects of those. For this project, **Apollo Server** has been used.
